# Manage Anomx Data

Before creating or changing data objects, retrieve the current object and inspect the
relevant request schema in `GET /openapi.json`. Prefer canonical object references and
small `PATCH` payloads over replacing whole records. Never infer identifiers, units,
connector settings, or destructive intent.

Common endpoints include `/datasets`, `/channels`, `/files`,
`/integrations`, and `/integrations/connector-catalog`. Search for an existing object
before creating one. After a write, read the returned or updated object and verify the
requested fields, relationships, ownership scope, and timestamps.

List endpoints automatically accept filters for serialized model fields. Use exact
filters such as `status=active`, lookup suffixes such as `name__icontains=temperature`,
`created_at__gte=<timestamp>`, `id__in=<id1,id2>`, and negation with `__not` or
`__not_in`. Use `ordering=<field>` or `ordering=-<field>`, `query=<text>` for model
search fields, and `limit`/`offset` for pagination. Invalid or non-serialized fields are
rejected instead of being silently ignored.
